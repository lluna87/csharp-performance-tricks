Matrix multiplication

Write a method Multiplyin the classExercisethat expects two 2-dimensionalmatrices of type Matrix,and multiplies them.

So for the following input matrices:

|1 2 3|    | 7  8|
|4 5 6|    | 9 10|
           |11 12|

I expect the following output:

| 58  64|
|139 154|

The example code works fine, but it is inefficient, your task is to speed up the code. Identify the performance bottleneck and refactor the code accordingly.
